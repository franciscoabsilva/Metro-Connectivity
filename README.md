# Metro-Connectivity
Second Project for Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

## Introduction
This project involves creating an algorithm to determine the correct parenthesization of a sequence of binary operations (âŠ•) to achieve a desired result, given a custom operation table and input sequence. The output should indicate if this is possible and provide the leftmost parenthesization.
