# Metro-Connectivity
Second Project for Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing an algorithm to analyze the connectivity of a metro network, modeled as an undirected multigraph. The goal is to calculate the metro connectivity index (mc), which represents the maximum number of line changes required to travel between any two stations in the network. The algorithm handles scenarios involving multiple lines, disconnected stations, and different levels of complexity, providing efficient and correct results. The output indicates the metro connectivity index or specific cases such as no required line changes or disconnected stations.
